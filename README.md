# Repository for coding test prep

## Approach
- Language: Java
- Tools Used: Only Java, no IDE or external resources
- Source: Programmers & Baekjoon

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- Date-based Folders: Each day has a folder named after the date (e.g., P_20250223).
- Problem-specific Classes: Inside each date folder, classes are named after the problem solved on that day.
- Solution Method: Each class contains a solution method that implements the solution for the respective problem.

## Goal
This repository aims to improve algorithm skills using Java and help prepare for coding tests by focusing on efficient coding, debugging, and time complexity optimization.
